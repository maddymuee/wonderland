<p><span class="firstcharacter blue">A</span>LICE was a little startled by seeing a large Cheshire Cat which was sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off and grinning from ear to ear. It looked good- natured, she thought: still it had <i>very</i> long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheshire Puss,&rdquo; she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. &ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s pleased so far,&rdquo; thought Alice, and she went on. &ldquo;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&rdquo;

</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care where—&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter which way you go,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—so long as I get <i>somewhere,</i>&rdquo; Alice added as an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re sure to do that,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;if you only walk long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice felt this could not be denied, so she tried another question. &ldquo;What sort of people live around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>that</i> direction,&rdquo; the Cat said, waving its right paw round, &ldquo;lives a Hatter: and in <i>that</i> direction,&rdquo; waving the other paw, &ldquo;lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they&rsquo;re both mad.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to go among mad people,&rdquo; Alice remarked.
 </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said the Cat:</p>
<img src="images/mad.png" class="callout">
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mad. You&rsquo;re mad.&rdquo;</p>
 
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m mad?&rdquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t have come here. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?&rdquo;</p>
 
<p>&ldquo;I should like it very much,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t been invited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see me there,&rdquo; said the Cat, and it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p>
 
<p>&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;ve often seen a cat without a grin,&rdquo; thought Alice; &ldquo;but a grin without a cat! It&rsquo;s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!&rdquo;
