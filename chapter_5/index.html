<p><span class="firstcharacter red">A</span>LICE found herself in a beautiful garden, among bright flower-beds and cool fountains. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round.</p>
<p>
First came ten soldiers; next the ten courtiers. After these came the royal children. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, and, last of all this grand procession, came
</p></div>

 <p>
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, child?&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,&rdquo; said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn&rsquo;t be afraid of them!&rdquo;</p>
<img src="images/croquet.jpg" class="callout">
<p> shouted the Queen.</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; shouted Alice.</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;Come on, then!&rdquo; roared the Queen. &ldquo;Get to your places!&rdquo;</p>
<p>People began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p>

<div class="blocktextleft">
<p data-aos="fade-in">The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, but just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it <i>would</i> twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

 <p>
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting &ldquo;Off with his head!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Off with her head!&rdquo; about once in a minute.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cry of &ldquo;The trial&rsquo;s beginning!&rdquo; was heard in the distance, and the players hurried off.</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;What trial is it?&rdquo; Alice asked the White Rabbit as it passed; but the Rabbit only answered &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; and ran the faster.
