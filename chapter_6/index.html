<p><span class="firstcharacter red">T</span>HE King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—&ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d get the trial done,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and hand round the refreshments!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herald, read the accusation!&rdquo; said the King.</p>
 <p>
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:</p></div></div>
<div class="blocktext">

 <p>
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again.
 </p>
 <p>
&ldquo;Call the first witness,&rdquo; said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, &ldquo;First witness!&rdquo;</p>


<p>
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the witness would be like. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name &ldquo;Alice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you know about this business?&rdquo; the King said to Alice.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing whatever?&rdquo; asked the Queen.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;Let the jury consider their verdict,&rdquo; the King said.</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Sentence first—verdict afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said Alice loudly. &ldquo;The idea of having the sentence first!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; said the Queen, turning purple.</p>
 <p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
 <p>

<img src="images/head.jpg" class="callout">
<p> the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares for you?&rdquo; said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.)</p>

<p>Alice found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Alice dear!&rdquo; said her sister; &ldquo;Why, what a long sleep you&rsquo;ve had!&rdquo;</p>
 <p class="smallbottom">
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had such a curious dream!&rdquo; said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, &ldquo;It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo; So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
