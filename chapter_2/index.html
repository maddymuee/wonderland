<p class="smallbottom" data-aos="fade-in">Alice found herself in a thick wood. "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; I think that will be the best plan. Let me see — how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?"</p>

<p class="bigbottom" data-aos="fade-in">
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
</p>

<p class="bigbottom" data-aos="fade-in">At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p>

<p><div data-aos="fade-in">

 <p class="bigbottom" data-aos="fade-in">said the Caterpillar.
 </p>
<div data-aos="fade-in">
    <p>
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, "I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I <i>was</i> when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then."
 </p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar sternly. "Explain yourself!"</p>
<p>
"I can't explain <i>myself</i>, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm not myself, you see."
</p>
<p>
"I don't see," said the Caterpillar.
</p>
<p>Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such <i>very</i> short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I think you ought to tell me who <i>you</i> are, first."</p>
<p>"Why?" said the Caterpillar.</p>
</div></div>


</div>


<div id="block4">
<div class="blocktext">

<div class="bigbottom" data-aos="fade-in">Alice could not think of any good reason. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, "One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter."</p>
<p>
"One side of <i>what</i>? The other side of <i>what</i>?" thought Alice to herself.</p>
<p>
"Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
</p>
</div>

<div class="smallbottom" data-aos="fade-in">
<p>Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
 </p>
<p>
"And now which is which?" she said to herself. She set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
